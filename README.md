# DSPAssemblerUI
 A Dyson Sphere Program Mod to enhance the Assembler UI Window.
 
 It shows the production speeds of the produced items below the corresponding output slots in the window, 
 as well as the consumption speed of the input items above the input slots.
 This way, you can plan your factory setup more easily without having to calculate your in- and outputs yourself.

 The speed info for both input and output can be disabled, should you prefer not showing one of them. 
 Or both of them - even though I don't understand why you would install this mod in the first place then...


## Version History
- v1.0.0 First Version. Shows Production Speeds below Items.
- v1.1.0 Updated to also show input consumption speeds. Added configuration to enable/disable input and output speeds separately.
